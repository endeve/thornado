General Relativistic Hydrodynamics
##################################

******************
Mathematical Model
******************

The equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics can be expressed as a
system of hyperbolic conservation laws,
representing the conservation of baryon number, momentum, and energy, all
as measured by an Eulerian observer (as defined in the 3+1 decomposition).
